summary(assignment2)
#R-sq = 0.746
#74.6% of the variance of the response variable is being explained by this model.
#Age is significantly correlating with BFSiri. So with every unit increase in age, BFSiri increases by 0.66. 
#Weight is significantly correlating with BFSiri. So with every unit increase in weight, BFSiri decreases by 0.09.
#Neck, ....
#Hip circumference does not significantly correlate with BFSiri. 
#All are continuous variables.
#AIC is used for model selection and we need a small AIC.
